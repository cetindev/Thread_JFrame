# Thread_JFrame
Transferring text over buttons with thread

I have tried to write a small program in the task by printing all the prime numbers for 1 second (1000 millisecond) delayed forever 
with the threads and pressing the Stop button and the flow continues when we press the Continue button.
I threw the prime numbers found in a prime number finding algorithm into an array and sent the values in that sequence one by one 
to the relevant buttons.
Thread updateThread = new Thread () {}
It happens inside the function, while doing this homework I had a few problems because I didn't know that the Run () function in 
the Thread function would be inside the function. But then on the internet
